// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis_of_Requirements = "This is the second step, in which an analysis of the software and the requirements for using this software are taken into consideriation by determining the use and need for this software and the users who will be utilizing this software" 
const Design = "This is the third step, in which the developer will create the design of their software by choosing the correct tools such as hardware and platforms such as javascript, the overall user interface will also be determined and created in this step"
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the developer will implement their decisions for the design and requirements for their project to create their software " 
const Testing_and_Integration = "this is the fifth step, in which the developer will test the overall compnents of their build to see how the individual parts of their software is running. They will also be testing in order to fix potential bugs and problems in the software" 
const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which the developers will utilize their testing to maintain the best quality possible for their software, this step will only occur if all of the past steps were successful in their task"
